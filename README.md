In 2018, nearly 2 million new breast cancer cases were diagnosed.
It is estimated that 627,000 women died from breast cancer. 
That is approximately 15% of all cancer deaths among women
In order to improve breast cancer outcomes and survival, early detection is critical.

So we came up with an idea to make an application with a vision that people from all around the world will have the resources to consult a doctor. People from all over the world will get access to all information relating Breast Cancer.

Introducing **HealthX**

- Information about all your essential diet and exercise to reduce the chance of having breast cancer.
- Choice of language for the user for dissolving the language barrier among people worldwide and having a wider reach.
- Uploading and storing of presciptions/X-rays in chat section to get advise from doctors worldwide.

     3) After choosing gender, a rough estimate will be shown in 3 different colours. If the precentage/estimate is in **GREEN** colour then the user is safe or having any other      medical problem other than Breast Cancer. If the percentage is shown in **Orange** colour, then the person is in gray area and must consult a doctor soon. If the percentage is shown in **RED** colour, then the person must immediately visit a doctor. Along with these a link is provided in the Dialogue box which calculates **Risk of Breast Cancer** with an algorithm published by the US Government itseld.
